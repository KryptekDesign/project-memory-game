## Instructions

This is browser-based version of the classic kids card game, requiring memory and observation to win.

Eight pairs of cards are randomly dealt face down. The objective is to match pairs of cards.

You take turns by flipping two cards and seeing if they match. Matches will stay on the board and mismatches will be flipped back over.

The game ends when you run out of moves or match all the cards.

This particular version gives you sixty seconds or twenty-five moves to accomplish the goal.

Have fun!
